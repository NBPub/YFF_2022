## [HTML to DataFrames](/processing_examples/html_to_df.py)

Web pages containing the fantasy tables were saved locally then processed.
The example script shows how the information may be extracted from the files.

The first table contains the fantasy data. The next 3 tables serve as a glossary for the various abbreviations used. 
These will be the same for each page.

The fantasy table is slightly different for Offense, Team Defense, and Individual Defensive Players. 
Note that the function in the example is meant for Offense tables.

Lastly, the player name extraction is not perfect; and I had to manually correct a few entries.
